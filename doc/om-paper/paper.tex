\section{Introduction}

Fault-tolerant distributed systems are the backbone of reliable life-critical systems, like avionics. Consequently, this class of systems demand high-assurance of correct design and implementation. Formal verification can be used to prove correctness.

There is substantial literature on verifying fault-tolerant distributed systems~\cite{}. Most of this work uses interactive theorem-proving~\cite{}. Interactive theorem-proving is useful in the domain because of the complexity of the models and because distributed system verification is typically parameterized by the number of nodes; automated methods perform poorly along these two metrics. However, two problems with interactive verification are that it requires specialized expertise and it is labor intensive.

In contrast, model-checking is automated but has limited scalability. To address scalability, abstractions and optimizations are employed, both of which lead to problems.

For example, verification abstractions are often ad-hoc and system-specific. For example, to model a process that can broadcast the values $\{0, 1\}$, or no value when faulty, one might define an enumerated type of broadcast values sent such as

$$\{0, 1, NONE\}$$

However, the enumeration conflates environment artifacts (i.e., faults) and system artifacts. Conflating them makes formal model-to-code correspondence more difficult to achieve. An example of a verification optimization is to model message passing as shared state between processes. While these optimizations might be safe under particular assumptions, they can lead to unsound models when a system or its environment is modified.

Our contributions combine a number of ideas in the formal verification literature to build scalable, generic formal models of fault-tolerant distributed systems in which verification is more automated than in traditional interactive theorem-proving. We describe a generic formal model for fault-tolerant distributed systems that aims to reduce the need for ad-hoc verification abstractions and optimizations while maintaining scalability in Section~\ref{sec:model}. The model combines several formalisms from the literature to efficiently but systematically model and verify a broad class of systems. The model extends \emph{calendar automata}, originally developed by Dutertre and Sorea~\cite{Dutertre-Sorea}. A calendar automata is a model inspired by discrete-event simulation, used in testing real-time systems~\cite{}.  Calendar automata have previously been used to verify bounded asynchronous systems~\cite{}; here we verify a synchronous system.

The model also employs \emph{synchronous observers}~\cite{}. Synchronous observers are a modeling abstraction in which an ``observer'' actor is synchronously composed with the system under verification. We use synchronous observers to impose fault model constraints on the system. Doing so makes the fault-model compositional with the system and easy to modify. We also use synchronous observers to observe safety properties, eliding the need for complex linear temporal logic specifications. Finally, we use an \emph{abstract state machine}~\cite{}, also composed with the system under verification using synchronous observation. The abstract state machine simplifies discovering invariants and debugging counterexamples.

We validate the model with a number of small examples \lee{todo}, as well as an extended case-study, verifying the Oral Messages (1) protocol (OM(1))~\cite{}. While our model is more detailed---it explicitly models channels---and also more general---it allows bounded asynchrony between processes---it is the most scalable model-checking verification of the protocol.

\lee{finish intro...  One more contribution is that we abstract faults using partially interpreted functions in model-checking, which is new? Note focus is on infinite-state model-checking}

 %% Timed automata are an alternative to the \emph{timed automata} formalism~\cite{}, as implemented in model-checkers like UPPAAL~\cite{} and Kronos~\cite{}.

\section{Formal Model}\label{sec:model}
Here we describe our formal model specialized for fault-tolerant distributed systems. There are three principal abstractions we describe: calendar automata, synchronous observers, and abstract state machines; we describe each below.

\subsection{Calendar Automata}\label{sec:calendar}\label{sec:calendar}
\emph{Timed automata} are specialized formalisms for verifying real-time systems~\cite{}. Timed automata assume the existence of continuously-varying real-valued variables, known as \emph{real-time clocks} in a solver. Timed automata model-checkers are specialized for verifying real-time systems in which the only infinite-valued variables are the real-time clocks. Modern general-purpose model-checkers like \lee{name some} use SMT solvers for general infinite-state system verification that is not limited to real-time clocks.

However, real-time system verification in general-purpose model-checkers requires an explicit formalism of real-time progression. Trying to encode real-time clocks directly is difficult; in particular, one must avoid Zeno's paradox in which no progress is made because state transitions simply update real-valued variables by an infinitesimally small amount~\cite{bruno,lamport}. To avoid this problem, Dutetre and Sorea developed \emph{calendar automata}~\cite{bruno}, which is itself inspired by event calendars used in discrete-event simulation.

Calendar automata avoid the problems of encoding timed automata. Rather than encoding ``how much time has passed since the last event'', it encodes ``how far into the future is the next scheduled event'', and a real-valued variable representing the current time is updated to the next event time. Doing so avoids Zeno updates.

Define a set of \emph{events} $e_0, e_1, \ldots, e_n \in E$. For now, we do not define events; intuitively, an event is a set of state variables (shortly, we will associate events with messages sent in a distributed system). When an event is \emph{enabled}, the transitions over events are enabled; otherwise, the variables stutter and maintain the same value.

An \emph{event calendar} $\{ (e_0, t_0), (e_1, t_1), \ldots, (e_n, t_n) \}$ is a set of ordered pairs $(e_i, t_i)$ called \emph{calendar events} where $e_i \in E$ is an event and $t_i \in \mathbb{R}$ is a \emph{timeout}, the time at which the event is scheduled. We denote element $(e_i, t_i)$ of an event calendar by $c_i$.

Let $cal$ be an event calendar and $c_i, c_j \in c$ be calendar events. Define an ordering on event calendars such that $c_i \leq c_j$ iff $t_i \leq t_j$, and $min(c) = \{ c_i | \forall c_j \in cal, \, c_i \leq c_j  \}$ are the minimum elements of $cal$.

Let a transition system $\mathcal{M} = (S, I, \rightarrow)$, be a set of states $S$, a set of initial states $I \subseteq S$, and a transition relation $\rightarrow \subseteq S \times S$. We implicitly assume a set of state variables such that a state $\sigma \in S$ is a total function that maps state variables to values. We distinguish two special state variables in a transition system: (1) $now \in \mathbb{R}$ denotes the current time in the state, and (2) $cal$ is an event calendar.

The following laws must hold of a transition system $\mathcal{M}$ implementing a calendar automaton:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{cal:a} Time is initialized to be less than or equal to every calendar timeout: $\forall \sigma \in I$, $\forall (e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$, $\sigma(now) \leq t_i$.

%% \item \label{cal:b} In all states, every calendar event occurs no sooner than the current time: $\forall \sigma \in S$, $(e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$, $t_i \geq \sigma(now)$.

\item \label{cal:c} In all states, if the current time is strictly less than every calendar event, then the only enabled transition is a \emph{time progress} update: $\forall \sigma \in S$, $\forall (e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$, if $\sigma(now) < t_i$, then $\forall \sigma'$ such that $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma'$, $\sigma' = \sigma[now := min(c)]$.

\item \label{cal:d} In all states, if the current time equals a timeout, then the only transition enabled is a calendar event update associated with the timeout: $\forall \sigma \in S$, $\exists (e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$ such that $\sigma(now) = t_i$, then $\forall \sigma'$ such that $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma'$, $\sigma'(now) = \sigma(now)$, $\sigma'(c_j) = \sigma(c_j)$ for all $c_j \in \sigma(c)$ such that $c_j \neq c_i$, and $\sigma'(t_i) > \sigma(t_i)$.
\end{enumerate}

We prove some intermediate results from the laws. First, in every state, the timeouts are never in the past:
\begin{lemma}[Future timeouts]\label{lem:ft}
$\forall \sigma \in S$, $(e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$, $\sigma(now) \leq t_i$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By induction on states. In an initial state, the property holds immediately (Law~\ref{cal:a}). In the induction step, suppose $\sigma(now) \leq t_i$, for all $t_i$. If $\sigma(now) < t_i$, for all $t_i$, then the only possible transition is a time progress update to the minimum timeout (Law~\ref{cal:c}). Otherwise, if $\sigma(now) = t_i$, for some $t_i$, then the only possible transition is a calendar event update, incrementing $t_i$ but not $\sigma(now)$ (Law~\ref{cal:d}).
\end{proof}

Second, we prove that time is monotonic:
\begin{lemma}[Monotonic time]
$\forall \sigma, \sigma' \in S$, if $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma'$, then $\sigma'(now) \geq \sigma(now)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
From Lemma~\ref{lem:ft}, in $\sigma(now) \leq t_i$, for all $(e_i, t_i) \in \sigma(cal)$. For any $\sigma'$ such that $\sigma \rightarrow \sigma'$, either there is a time progress update (Law~\ref{cal:c}) or a calendar event update (Law~\ref{cal:d}). In the first case, $\sigma(now) < \sigma'(now)$, and in the second case, $\sigma(now) = \sigma'(now)$.
\end{proof}

In a distributed system, it is convenient to distinguish global actions and local actions. Global actions are principally interprocess communication, while local actions are those carried out by each process to update its local state and produce new messages to broadcast. While both global and local actions can both be modeled as events in a calendar automata, doing so is generally overkill and complicates the model. From the global perspective, individual processes can update their local state atomically.

Following Dutetre and Sorea, we associate calendar events with channels in a distributed system~\cite{dutetre}. Specializing calendars to message passing does not lose generality since all external communication from an individual process can be abstracted as message passing. Furthermore, typical fault models can be abstracted to act over channels rather than processes~\cite{abstractions}. The calendar introduces real-time constraints on when processes send and receive messages.

Assume processes are indexed from a finite set $Id \subset \mathbb{N}$. A \emph{channel} from process $i$ to $j$ is an ordered pair $(i,j)$. Define a set of messages $Msg$. Given a channel and a timeout, let $send$ be a relation on messages sent on a channel at a given time:
$$send \subseteq Id \times Id \times \mathbb{R} \times Msg$$
So $send(i, j, t, m)$ holds iff $i$ sends to $j$ message $m$ at time $t$. Likewise, let
$$recv \subseteq Id \times Id \times \mathbb{R} \times Msg$$
be a relation on messages received on a channel at a time, so that $recv(i, j, t, m)$ holds iff the message $m$ received by $j$ from $i$ at time $t$.

In the non-faulty case, we require that messages received were previously sent and not previously received: if $recv(i, j, t, m)$, then $\exists t'$ such that $send(i, j, t', m)$ where $t' < t$, and $\neg\exists t''$ such that $t' < t'' < t$ and $recv(i, j, t'', m) = recv(i, j, t, m)$. (We address faults in Section~\ref{sec:kibitzer}.)

Then an event calendar for sending and receiving messages on channels is the union of the $send$ and $recv$ relations.

\lee{technically, atomic time is just a convenience.}
The event of receiving a message initiates a process to update its local state machine and generate additional messages to send. When the process is updating its local state machine, the event calendar is paused. That is, updating an event $recv(i, j, t, m)$ also includes updating $j$'s state machine.

\lee{note that we don't need full generality of send and receive events in OM(1)}

\subsection{Synchronous Observers}\label{sec:sync}
Synchronous observers are state machines that are synchronously composed with a system specification to check properties over the system's state variables. Synchronous observers are a method for composing specifications with a program. Synchronous observers were first introduced in the context of the synchronous programming languages, such as Lustre~\cite{}. While synchronous observers have been part of model-checking folklore for some time, Rushby systematically describes their application to the domain~\cite{}. The general form for specifying synchronous observers is the following:
$$system | assumptions | requirements$$
\noindent
where `$|$' denotes synchronous composition of transition systems. The assumptions constrain the system's state variables, while the requirements monitor the system's state variables. More formally, define a transition subset relation:

\begin{definition}[Transition system subset]
For transition systems $M = (S, I, \rightarrow)$ and $M' = (S', I', \rightarrow')$, $M \subseteq M'$ if and only if $S \subseteq S'$, $I \subseteq I'$, and $\rightarrow \subseteq \rightarrow'$.
\end{definition}

Let the system, assumptions, and requirements each be the transition systems $\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{A}$, and $\mathcal{R}$, respectively. Then we require $A \subseteq S$. If the system is \emph{realizable}~\cite{} under its assumptions, then the set of states, initial states, and transition relation of $A$ are all nonempty. A system is \emph{correct} if $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathcal{R}$.

The benefit of the synchronous observer approach is that we can develop a system specification that contains no extraneous modeling context from which to synthesize an implementation. For example, we do not want to synthesize an implementation that injects faults! Furthermore, modifying assumptions and requirements is simpler when they are not distributed throughout the model.





% ------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Abstract State Machines}\label{sec:abstract}\label{sec:asms}
When model-checking a system, counterexamples to properties are traces of states. A state is a collection of variable values, and in large models, there are a lot. A single state includes assignments to each of the variables, and counterexample trace may be many 10s of states in length. In practice, counterexamples depend on a small number of state variables. The user has to manually separate the state variables that matter from those that do not for a specific property. It is not enough prevent variables that stutter from displaying since some state variables might be updated without affecting the property. The problem is particularly pertinent when model-checking models that have sufficient detail for implementation synthesis, as is the goal in our work.

Systems are usually designed in modes such that predicates on state variables are parameterized on which mode the system is in. The transition between modes implements a finite state-machine. The modes and the state-machine are usually implicit, but a property violation usually requires an unexpected mode transition. Abstracting counterexample traces over all of the state variables by traces over the modes helps to identify why a property fails quickly.

Our solution to the problem of constructing a mode-based state machine uses abstract state machines (ASMs). ASMs are a generalization of finite state machines originally developed by Gurevich to generalize the Church-Turing thesis for abstract data structures~\cite{}. Since then, ASMs have become an engineering technique for simulating a system at different levels of abstraction.

\lee{http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/sam/preprint/reisig203.pdf}
More precisely, we implement a sequential small-step ASM~\cite{}.
\begin{definition}[Sequential small-step ASM]
Let $V$ be a finite set of state variables. Let $s$ be an assignment of variables to values, and let $b$ be a relation Å
\end{definition}

\section{The Synchronous Kibitzer}\label{sec:kibitzer}
The typical approach to injecting faults into a formal model of a distributed system is to add a new state variables to each process representing its fault state. Then additional state variables are added to represent the nondeterminism introduced by faults into the state or messages by a process. Finally, additional transitions are added to each process to modify the process's state or messages based on it's current fault state.

This straightforward approach introduces substantial additional state and nondeterminism, reducing the scalability of model-checking. Modeling faults is particularly expensive given that additional state and nondeterminism is added to each process. These scalability issues are noted throughout the literature. For example, \lee{TTA startup paper, helmut's paper, etc.}

Not only is modeling faults expensive, but it is generally non-compositional. For example, in a classic model-checking model of the fault-tolerant Oral Messages algorithm~\cite{}, every transition of the sending processes updates environmental state variables associated with the fault state.

Another difficulty with adding faults to a model is that the number of states that must be introduced may be dependent non-obviously on other aspects of the fault model, specific protocol, and system size. Furthermore, since SAT-based model-checking is NP-complete, it is important not to introduce any state beyond the minimal required. Such constraints lead to ``meta-model'' reasoning, such as the following, as described by Rushby:

\begin{quote}
To achieve the full range of faulty behaviors, it seems that a faulty source should be able to send a different incorrect value to each relay, and this requires n different values. It might seem that we need some additional incorrect values 3 so that faulty relays can exhibit their full range of behaviors. It would certainly be safe to introduce additional values for this purpose, but the performance of model checking is very sensitive to the size of the state space, so there is a countervailing argument against introducing additional values. A little thought will show that the way faulty relays have their most significant impact is by tipping the majority vote in a receiver one way or the other, and this can only be achieved if they use the same values as nonfaulty relays. Hence, we decide against further extension to the range of values~\cite{}.
\end{quote}

To address these problems, we introduce a synchronous observer that injects faults that we call a \emph{synchronous kibitzer}. The kibitzer decomposes the state and transitions associated with the fault model from the system. For the sake of concreteness, we introduce a particular fault model, the hybrid fault model of Thambidurai and Park~\cite{}. The fault model distinguishes Byzantine (or arbitrary), symmetric, and manifest faults. This fault model applies to broadcast systems, in which a process is expected to broad the same value to multiple receivers. A \emph{Byzantine fault} is one in which a process that is intended to broadcast the same value to other processes may instead broadcast arbitrary values to different receivers (including no value or the correct value). A \emph{symmetric fault} is one in which a process may broadcast the same, but incorrect, value to other processes, and a \emph{manifest fault} is one in which a process's broadcast fault is detectable by the receivers; e.g., by performing a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) or because the value arrives outside of a predetermined window.

In specifying a fault-tolerant system, we must also specify a \emph{maximum fault assumption} (MFA), which specifies the maximum number of of each kind of fault that may be present in the system for some system property to hold. Define a enumeration of fault types $$\textnormal{FAULT\_TYPE} = \{none, byz, sym, man\}$$. As in the previous section, let $Id \subset \mathbb{N}$ be a finite set of indices, and let the variable $$faults: Id \rightarrow \textnormal{FAULT\_TYPE}$$ range over possible mappings from process indices to faults.

The hybrid fault model assumes a broadcast model of communication.
% Define $rnd: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that if $rnd(t_0) < rnd(t_1)$, then $t_0 < t_1$.
A $broadcast: Id \rightarrow 2^{Id} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \rightarrow Msg \rightarrow 2^{E}$ takes a sender, a set of receivers, a real-time, and a message to send each receiver, and returns a set of calendar events:
$$broadcast(i, R, t, m) = \{m | j \in R \textnormal{ and } send(i, j, t) = m\}$$

\lee{msg in SAL is recv here}

With this machinery, we can define the semantics of faults by constraining the relationship between a message broadcast and the values received by the recipients. For a nonfaulty process that broadcasts, every recipient receives the sent message.
\begin{align*}
&nonfaulty\_constraint =\\
  &\quad \forall i, j \in Id, t \in \mathbb{R}.\\
  &\quad\quad faults(i) = none\\
  &\quad\quad\quad \textnormal{ implies } recv(i, j, t) = send(i, j, t)
\end{align*}
\noindent
For symmetric faults, we there is no requirement that the messages sent are the ones received, only that every recipient receives the same value.
\begin{align*}
&sym\_constraint =\\
  &\quad \forall i, j, k \in Id, t \in \mathbb{R}.\\
  &\quad\quad (faults(i) = sym \textnormal{ and } broadcast(i, \{j, k\}, t, m))\\
  &\quad\quad\quad \textnormal{ implies } recv(i, j, t) = recv(i, k, t)
\end{align*}
\noindent
Byzantine faults are left completely unconstrained.
