## Improving and Benchmarking Our OM(1)

 * Inductive proof of agreement
 * Hybrid fault model
 * Parametrization on the number of nodes
 * Model checking complexity & comparison with Rushby

# Inductive proof of agreement

## Proof

We completed an inductive proof of the remaining property holding for OM(1),
*agreement*

The proof is aided by two techniques,

 1. a coarse abstract state machine
 2. history variables at points relevant to data flow


## Abstract State Machine
